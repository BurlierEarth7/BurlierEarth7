# Ko-Fi Commision Terms of Service

Last Updated: 2025-12-26

By accessing or using these services, you agree to be **bound** by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not request a commission.

## Payments and Deposits

Details such as scope, deliverables, style, format, pricing, and timeline will vary per commission. Because commissions are custom, the final product may slightly vary from initial concepts or examples, provided it reasonably aligns with the agreed-upon description.

Depending on the scope of the commission, an initial, **non-refundable** deposit may be required. The deposit amount and payment schedule will be communicated and agreed upon prior to the start of the commission.

Work will not begin until after the initial deposit has been received, if an initial deposit is required.

Failure to submit an initial deposit within the alloted timeframe will result in the cancellation of the commission.

All final products are provided "as is". Further modifications are out of scope of the commission, and may cost extra depending on the modifications.

## Product Delivery

Estimated delivery timelines will be provided at the start of the commission. These timelines are *estimates* and are subject to change, based on complexity, revision requests, or delays outside of reasonable assumption.

The client agrees to provide clear instructions, reference material, and feedback in a timely manner. Delays caused by the client may result in adjusted delivery dates without penalty to the service provider.

Delivery will occur through the agreed method once the commission is complete, and payment requirements are met.

## Product Revisions and Modifications

The commission includes a **limited** number of revisions, based on the agreed upon details. Revisions are intended to make **small** adjustments, and do not include major adjustments to the original concept.

Requests that **significantly** alter the scope, concept, or direction of the commission are considered **commission modifications** and may require additional fees and/or extended timelines. I reserve the right to decline modification requests that fall outside the original agreement.

## Limitations and Liability

I am not responsible for dissatisfaction resulting from unclear instructions, omitted information, or changes in client preference after work has begun.

To the maximum extent permitted by law, I am not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from the commission.

## Refund Information

Due to the nature of commissions, **refunds are generally not available once work has begun**.

If a commission is cancelled before work starts, a full refund may be issued. If cancelled after work begins, a partial refund may be issued at my discretion, based on the amount of work completed.

Completed commissions are **non-refundable**.

## Acceptance of Terms

By submitting a commission request, or by making payment, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to these Terms of Service.
